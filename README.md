# Swift Concurrency Reviewer

A Claude Code plugin for reviewing Swift PRs for concurrency issues. Supports two output modes: **learn** (educational with explanations and learning resources) and **concise** (issues + fixes only).

## Prerequisites

This plugin requires the [Swift Concurrency Agent Skill](https://github.com/AvdLee/Swift-Concurrency-Agent-Skill) by Antoine van der Lee.

### Install the Swift Concurrency Skill

**Step 1:** Add the marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add AvdLee/Swift-Concurrency-Agent-Skill
```

**Step 2:** Install the skill

```
/plugin install swift-concurrency@swift-concurrency-agent-skill
```

The plugin uses this skill as its source of truth for all concurrency analysis, decision trees, and recommended patterns.

## Installation

### Add the Marketplace

```
/plugin marketplace add pavliuko/swift-concurrency-reviewer
```

### Install the Plugin

```
/plugin install swift-concurrency-reviewer@swift-concurrency-reviewer
```

### Alternative: Test Locally

```bash
claude --plugin-dir /path/to/swift-concurrency-reviewer
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```
/swift-concurrency-reviewer:pr-review
```

This runs in **learn** mode by default — educational explanations with learning resources.

### Concise Mode

Issues and fixes only:

```
/swift-concurrency-reviewer:pr-review concise
```

### Learn Mode

Educational explanations with learning resources:

```
/swift-concurrency-reviewer:pr-review learn
```

## How It Works

1. **Command** (`/pr-review`) checks prerequisites, identifies Swift files changed in the PR, and formats the final output
2. **Agent** (`review-agent`) coordinates the review and returns structured JSON findings
3. **Skill** (`swift-concurrency`) performs the actual analysis using its decision trees and patterns

The agent never analyzes concurrency on its own — it delegates everything to the skill to ensure consistent, accurate recommendations.

## Tips

- **Run before merging**: Catch concurrency issues before they land in main
- **Use learn mode**: When learning Swift concurrency or onboarding team members
- **Use concise mode**: For quick PR checks during active development
- **Check prerequisites**: Ensure the `swift-concurrency` skill is installed
