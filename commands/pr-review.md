# Swift Concurrency PR Review

Run a Swift concurrency review on a pull request using the specialized `review-agent` powered by the `swift-concurrency` skill.

**Arguments:** "$ARGUMENTS"

## Review Workflow:

1. **Dependency Check**

   Verify all required plugins are available:

   - Check if the `swift-concurrency` skill/plugin is installed and accessible
   - Record the result (plugin name, version if available, status)
   - If the plugin is NOT available:
     - Display an error message explaining the missing dependency
     - Exit immediately

2. **Parse Arguments**

   Parse the provided arguments to determine review mode:

   - `--style=reviewer` - Concise, professional code review style (issues + fixes only)
   - `--style=tutor` - Educational style with explanations and learning resources (DEFAULT)
   - `--include-learning` - Include learning URLs
   - `--no-learning` - Exclude learning URLs

   **Defaults:**
   - Style: `tutor`
   - Learning: `--include-learning` for tutor mode, `--no-learning` for reviewer mode

3. **Determine Review Scope**

   - Check if PR exists: `gh pr view --json number,headRefName,baseRefName`
   - If no PR exists, report that and exit
   - Get the PR's changed files: `gh pr diff --name-only`
   - Filter to only `.swift` files
   - If no Swift files changed, report that and exit

4. **Detect GitHub Base URL**

   Construct the base URL for clickable file links:
   - Run `git remote get-url origin` to get the remote URL
   - Use the PR's head branch from step 3
   - Parse owner/repo from the remote URL
   - Construct: `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/blob/{head_branch}/`
   - Store as `github_base` for passing to the agent

5. **Launch Review Agent**

   Launch the `swift-concurrency-reviewer:review-agent` agent with the parsed configuration:

   ```
   Task tool with subagent_type: swift-concurrency-reviewer:review-agent
   Prompt: Review the following Swift files for concurrency issues.
           Style: [reviewer|tutor]
           Include learning resources: [true|false]
           GitHub base URL: [github_base]
           Files: [list of changed Swift files]
   ```

6. **Format Final Output**

   The agent returns JSON with this structure:
   ```json
   {
     "total_issues": N,
     "issues": [{ "file", "lines", "category", "severity", "problem", "code", "fix", "explanation", "learn_url" }]
   }
   ```

   Parse the JSON and format output based on style. This is the ONLY output shown to the user.

   ### If no issues found:
   ```markdown
   ## Swift Concurrency Review ✓

   No concurrency issues found in the changed Swift files.

   **Files reviewed:**

## Prerequisites:

- The `swift-concurrency` plugin must be installed
- A pull request must exist for the current branch

## Notes:

- The agent uses the Swift Concurrency skill as its source of truth
- All recommendations follow the skill's decision tree and patterns
- Learning URLs are fetched directly from https://fuckingapproachableswiftconcurrency.com/en/
- Reviews only files changed in the PR, not the entire codebase
